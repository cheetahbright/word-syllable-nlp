"""Utilities for computing readability metrics.

This module exposes a small ``Text`` class that can be used to
calculate several readability statistics for a piece of text.  The
original project bundled a large amount of experimental code and
executed it on import, which made the module difficult to use in other
code and impossible to test.  The implementation below keeps just the
relevant pieces and ensures the module can be imported safely.
